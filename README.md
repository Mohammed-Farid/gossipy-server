# Gossipy

Gossipy is a simple social media web application where users can create stations and gossip about all their fantasies!

## Motivation

As I've created multiple projects I noticed that I've not been through multiple entities projects with a lot of features all I had before were pinpoint projects which were targeted to learn a specific skill.

For the last 4 months I evolved myself into learning more new technologies and tried to apply them in Gossipy. Technologies such as GraphQL, [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) and most importantly [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) in both Apollo and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## New Technologies Used

* GraphQL / Prisma

I've used Prisma to generate my schema and other ORM methods. Prisma has a massive capability of making convenient methods to control project entities.

* Typescript

I used this project to learn a lot about Typescript which will continue to be used in the upcoming projects.

* PostgreSQL / PGAdmin

This was a scratch of knowledge as I used prisma as contractor with my database. I'll dive deeper within SQL in other projects.

* AWS S3

I used [Amazon Web Services S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to upload user avatars, station pictures and topics content.
